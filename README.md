# git-nag-push

GitNagPush by Uri Kalish.

This cmd file will try to pull, rebase, and push until it succeeds, while sleeping for X minutes between failed attempts.
Ideal for pushing to soon-to-melt frozen branches while enjoying sushi for lunch.

**Before the first use, please configure the PERSONALIZED SETTINGS section in the file.**
